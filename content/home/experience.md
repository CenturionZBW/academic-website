  Developing from the distributed Massive MIMO system, the Cell-Free Massive MIMO system gradually becomes one of the most promising structures for the next generation mobile communication system.
  
  * Analyzed the model of Cell-Free Massive MIMO system and simulated the downlink and uplink spectrual efficiency with different precoding and combining algortihms when considering fronthaul limitaion
  * Designed a precoding and combining scheme based on Convolutional Neural Network, which improves spectrual efficiency of the system while maintaining a relatively low computation complexity
  * Proposed a novel user-centric architecture to solve scability problem faced by Cell-Free Massive MIMO system, and optimized the AP selection schemes
